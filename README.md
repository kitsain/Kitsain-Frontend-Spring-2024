## About
This repository is for a an application where food ingredients at hand are sent to the software that calls OpenAI API to retrieve recipe suggestions for those ingredients. Documentation for API endpoints can be found [here](./documentation/restapidocs.md).

The recipe tab is by University of Helsinki students for [the software engineering project course](https://studies.helsinki.fi/kurssit/toteutus/otm-4dab3f07-4ba7-4ae1-a269-ee1e0817c66c/TKT20007/Ohjelmistoprojekti) and the rest of the tabs are made by another team.
